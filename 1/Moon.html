  <p>
    The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet
    <a href="Earth.html" target="_blank">Earth</a>, being Earth's only permanent
    natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar
    System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of
    the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io,
    the Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those
    whose densities are known.
