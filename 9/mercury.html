							Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its
							orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It
							is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the
							gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes
							(Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior
							planet; its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.

							Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30
							degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar
							System;[b] at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or
							66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is
							similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive
							for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface
							temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System,
							ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the
							day across the equatorial regions.[22] The polar regions are constantly below 180 K
							(−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no natural satellites.

							The ancients knew Mercury by different names depending on whether it was an evening
							star or a morning star. By about 350 BC, the ancient Greeks had realized the two stars
							were one.[26] They knew the planet as Στίλβων Stilbōn, meaning "twinkling", and Ἑρμής
							Hermēs, for its fleeting motion,[27] a name that is retained in modern Greek (Ερμής
							Ermis).[28] The Romans named the planet after the swift-footed Roman messenger god,
							Mercury (Latin Mercurius), which they equated with the Greek Hermes, because it moves
							across the sky faster than any other planet.[26][29] The astronomical symbol for
							Mercury is a stylized version of Hermes' caduceus; a Christian cross was added in the
							16th century: ☿.
