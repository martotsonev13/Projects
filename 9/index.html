					The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects
					that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[b] Of those objects that orbit the Sun
					directly, the largest eight are the planets,[c] with the remainder being smaller objects,
					such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun
					indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[d]
				</p>
				<p>
					The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
					interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with
					the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets,
					Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock
					and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than
					the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed
					mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice
					giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared
					with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight
					planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the
					ecliptic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[e] The asteroid belt, which lies between
					the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial
					planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc,
					which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them
					a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations are several dozen to
					possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their
					own gravity.[10] Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets
					include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris.[e] In addition
					to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and
					interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, at least
					four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural
					satellites,[f] usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is
					encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.
